## Developing

### Setup

When you first clone this repository, run:

```sh
lein setup
```

This will create files for local configuration, and prep your system
for the project.

### Environment

To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
lein repl
```

Run `go` to initiate and start the system.

```clojure
user=> (go)
:started
```

By default this creates a web server at <http://localhost:3000>.

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and restart the server.

```clojure
user=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
:started
```

### Generators

This project has several [generators][] to help you create files.

* `lein gen endpoint <name>` to create a new endpoint
* `lein gen component <name>` to create a new component
